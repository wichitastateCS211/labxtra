# Becoming Self-Sufficient
Write a python program that takes a single argument from the CLI. For example: `> python3 lab.py 42`.

You will need to read the `argparse` tutorial found here: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html  
**NOTE:** You do not need read the entire tutorial. You are only going to create and use a single positional
argument.

The program will take a single positional argument, and print it to the screen as a part of the following sentence.
`You passed {} to the program.` where `{}` is replaced with the argument.

## Sample Runs
```
> python3 wsuid_labxtra.py 42
You passed 42 to the program.
```
```
> python3 wsuid_labxtra.py "A1 Sauce"
You passed A1 Sauce to the program.
```

## Hints
- The purpose of this lab is not a programming principle. It's just a small exercise in going out and learning
a new thing to use in your programs on your own. As such, I will not discuss using argparse in class.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_labxtra.py
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
